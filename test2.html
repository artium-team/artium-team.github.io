    <h1>Artium</h1>
    <p>Artium is a group of students who love code and want to use it to make the world a better place. We work on various projects that involve artificial intelligence, web development, data science, and more.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to use our coding skills to solve real-world problems and create positive impact. We believe that code is a powerful tool that can be used for good, and we want to share our passion and knowledge with others.</p>
    <h2>Our Projects</h2>
    <p>Some of the projects that we have worked on or are currently working on are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI</strong>: We have created an artificial intelligence model that can generate graphical artwork based on a prompt. For example, if you give it the prompt "a dragon", it will draw a picture of a dragon. You can try it out <a href="^2^">here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>End World Hunger</strong>: We have developed a web application that connects donors with local food banks and charities that fight hunger. The app allows donors to donate food items, money, or volunteer time, and also provides information on the causes and effects of hunger. You can visit the app <a href="^3^">here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>NTP Haunted House</strong>: We have participated in the NTP Halloween Hackathon 2023 and created a haunted house game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is a spooky adventure where you have to explore a haunted house and find clues to escape. You can play the game <a href="^4^">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
